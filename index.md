The overarching goal of the Infant, Child & youth Health (INCH) Lab at The University of Texas at San Antonio is to improve the health and wellbeing of children, youth, and emerging adults through the promotion, adoption and maintenance of healthy active lifestyles. Our research progresses towards this goal through understanding barriers and facilitators to physical activity engagement as well as the mental health consequences of being physically (in)active. We conduct primary data collection studies in our local community, in addition to leveraging access to publicly available datasets for secondary analyses. This work is important because the peak onset of mental health problems occurs in adolescence and insufficient physical activity is known to be a contributing factor.
