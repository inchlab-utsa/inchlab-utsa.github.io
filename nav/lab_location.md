The INCH Lab is located in the basement of the Multidisciplinary Studies (MS) building in room 1.02.46. You can enter the building through the door adjacent to the Flawn Science Building at the bottom of the stairs that lead up to the Sombrilla Plaza. You will see signage on the windows of the entrance door that say Athletics Academic Services. Enter the door and walk down the hallway, taking your first right and following the hallway past the washrooms. You'll eventually see the INCH Lab signs.
