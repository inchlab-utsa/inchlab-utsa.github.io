Purpose of the Study and Reason for Your Involvement: To understand and model how individual depressive symptoms and physical activity influence each other over time.

### Eligibility: We invite you to take part in a research study because you are:

• A student enrolled at UTSA

• Between the age of 18-29 years

• Have a web-enabled smart phone

• No mobility impairments

Participation in the Study:

• Whether or not you take part is up to you and entirely voluntary.

• You can agree to take part in the study and later change your mind.

• Your decision not to participate will not be held against you.

• At any time you may ask any questions concerning the study before and during participation.

Contact information: If you have questions, concerns, complaints, or believe the research has harmed you, you may talk to the research team at: christopher.huong@utsa.edu
This research is being overseen by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). You may also talk to them at IRB@utsa.edu if you have questions regarding your rights as a research participant or other questions, concerns, or complaints.

### Participant Role in the Research Study:

If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to:

1. Complete an anonymous baseline survey (~20 min) about factors that influence your physical activity behavior and your mental health.

2. Visit our lab to pick up a physical activity monitor, which will be fitted on your wrist like a watch. You will also be set up with the Pathverse smartphone app, which will send you short (~2 minute) survey prompts to respond to 5x/day.

3. You will wear the physical activity monitor 24 hr/day for 14 full days, only taking it off when submerged in water (e.g., swimming).

4. You will respond to as many smartphone question prompts as feasible over the course of your participation. Each prompt has 9 questions and occurs 5 times a day for 14 days, resulting in a total of 70 prompts over the entire study period.

5. After the 14-day study period, you will return the physical activity monitor to the lab, where we will download your data from the device. You may also uninstall the Pathverse smartphone app at this time.


### Compensation
You may receive up to $25 ($10 for completing baseline survey; plus $0 for completing <25% of prompts; $5 for completing between 25% and 50% of the prompts; $10 for completing between 50% and 75% of the prompts; $15 for completing 75% or more of the prompts.

You must also wear the physical activity monitor for a minimum of 12 hours per day for at least 12 out of the 14 study days to qualify for compensation above the $10 for the baseline survey. Adherence to the physical activity monitor wear-time criteria will be determined after the device is returned and the data is downloaded and processed.

Upon completion of the study you may also request by email to receive a summary of your individual data in the form of a personalized network. An example of this visualization can be found at the bottom of this page. A detailed description of the general study findings will also be provided.
